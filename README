### Bayesian Learning : Exploitation vs. Exploration
Here, we explore how humans tackle a complicated problem, such as reverse engineering a Bayesian network, as an iterative process involving a lot of try-and-fail, until convergence, closer to the true model.

Solving the Bayesian network involves exploration of new possible models, and exploitation of partial results already acquired during the multiple trials of the iterative process.

### Repository Organisation

This repository is organized in the following way:
- A *notebooks* folder with multiple Jupyter notebooks
- Some dedicated Python libraries
- A *manuscript* folder
