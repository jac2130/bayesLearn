\section{Exploitation versus Exploration}



\subsection{Shall we consider the 8 dimensions together or indepedent?}

the distance measure is a well performing dimension reduction, I think.  It is hard to think in eight dimensions or to make visual graphs but by varying the weights for the past models for this measure one can explore more of this exploitation-exploration dynamic in dimensions related to more intuitive ideas, such as time.  Also, the eight dimensions are intricately correlated so that they can not be seen as independent dimensions and the measure of exploration-exploitation accounts neatly for the differences in beliefs about these correlation structures.
