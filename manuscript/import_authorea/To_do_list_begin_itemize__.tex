\item (Johannes) Explanation rational Bayesian convergence being equal $\sqrt{t} = t^{1/2}$
\\
This follows from the Central Limit Theorem and from the fact that a rationally updated dirichlet conjugate prior acts as a counts model. For details see the following Wikipedia articles: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem}{Central Limit Theorem} and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution}{Dirichlet Distribution}. 
\item (Thomas) Explain the Hawkes Poisson Process as a {\bf candidate} model in this context of bounded rationality
\item (Thomas) Check dynamics as a function of 2 minutes sessions $\rightarrow$ Is there any coherent pattern between spikes and 2 minutes periods
\item (Johannes) Compute  matrices of distances between models as a function of time: The output should be triangular matrices
