\section{Propositions for explaining the difference between BL and HL}

This shall be supported by empirical evidence, but there are not zillions of possibilities: It certainly takes more time to come up with models which significantly reduce the distance to the true model. Reasons may be 

\begin{itemize}
\item lack of creativity
\item lack of trying (procrastination)
\item memory afterglow of already tested solutions (i.e., returning to already tested models which do not bring much)
\item increased time to think of new solutions leading to substantial improvement (looks like procrastination in some way), or to perform integration of various solutions tested previously.
\end{itemize}

I think we can formulate tests for nearly all these possibilities.
