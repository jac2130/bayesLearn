\section{Distribution of step-by-step performance}

Binned (100 bins) density function of distance between 2 steps. This distance can be positive, which is equivalent to adding distance compared to the true model (in red). On the contrary, a negative distance shows improvement (in green). Both sides are heavy-tailed distributions, with very good fits with a power law model (see both insets). However, the exponents are different for improvement (exponent = 2.25), compared to counter performance (exponent, 1.34). This discrepancy explains why on average participants make improvements at a pace of $\alpha = 0.9 = 2.25 - 1.34$ {\bf [formal demonstration needed here $\rightarrow$ it implies a stochastic process with stochastic increment given this distribution, which is equivalent (in my mind) to considering a balanced stochastic component with exponent 1.34 on both sides, and a deterministic drift of 0.09]}.
