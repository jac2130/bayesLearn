\section{experiment}

The aim of the experiment is to probe {\bf [to be completed...]}. The experiment was conducted at Columbia University's Social Science laboratory with 96 participants, who were asked to reverse engineer the conditional {\bf [or {\it joint probabilities}, as mentioned before?]}probabilities 3- and 4-node Bayesian Networks (48 participants for each treatment). The {\it simple} process had 3 binary variables, which means that the problem can be thought of as the simultaneous estimation of $(2^3) = 8$ parameters, or the 8 dimensional vector $\mathbf{s}$ with $0 \leqslant s_k  \leqslant 1$ for $k = \{1,...,8\}$ (resp. $k = \{1,..., 16\}$ for the 4 variable {\bf {\it complex} stochastic system) [$\rightarrow$ I don't understand why you mention the Bayesian Netwok as a complex stochastic system. Is there a reason for this?]}.\\

Participants were given 40 minutes in total, with a 10 minutes warm-up period to get used with the interface (see {\bf Supplementary Information (SI) for screenshots}), and start building models and perform already. The warm-up period is followed by 30 minutes, during which they were offered rewards for their progress {\bf [explain rewards/incentives in detail here]}. \\

The interface is organized as follows : {\bf [please describe all components, screens that the participants can see, and what action she could take action upon. This must be super detailed, as if you were instructing a blind person how to use the interface]}.\\

All changes made were recorded at a 1 second resolution, which provides unprecedented resolution on the fine-grained human behaviors when facing a ``hard problem".\\
