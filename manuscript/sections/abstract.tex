Learning complex systems most often not only involves continuous Markovian improvement, but also sharp explorative perspective changes, which are equivalent to resetting beliefs. This reset is usually considered as a random move performed, in order to explore yet unknown portions of the problem space. Here, we show a more subtle view, with a continuum between Markovian learning and sharp exploration. Furthermore, random exploration is actually not completely random, but rather involves a recombination of solutions explored much further in the past.
